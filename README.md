# Data_Structure

## Vector
that represents a dynamic array. It includes member functions for inserting, finding, and deleting elements in the array, as well as for rotating the elements to the left or right. The class uses dynamic memory allocation to manage the array's storage, and includes a destructor to free the memory when the object is destroyed. The code also includes some assertion statements to ensure that the array indices are within bounds, and a print function to display the contents of the array.



## Linked List
The code defines a linked list data structure using a Node struct and a Linked_List class.

The Linked_List class has several methods to manipulate the list, such as inserting nodes at the front or end of the list, deleting nodes, and searching for nodes.

The code also includes additional methods to delete duplicate nodes, move nodes with a given value, and delete the last occurrence of a node with a given value.

Finally, the main function provides an example of how to use some of these methods.
